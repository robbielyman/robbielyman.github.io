[]($section.id("summary"))

Seamstress is an “art engine”
and batteries-included Lua environment
for music, games, visuals and creative coding.
It is written in Lua and [Zig]($link.url("https://ziglang.org")),
and inspired by [monome]($link.url("https://monome.org")) [norns]($link.url("https://github.com/monome/norns")), [Love2D]($link.url("https://love2d.org/")), [Hydra]($link.url("https://hydra.ojack.xyz/")) and [Node.js]($link.url("https://nodejs.org/")).
Seamstress version 2 is alpha software.

# Installation

Seamstress version 2 is currently developed and tested on macOS,
but supporting Linux (and perhaps Windows) is a design goal.
It may be built from source or installed via [Homebrew]($link.url("https://brew.sh")).
To install via Homebrew, run the following commands.

[]($code.asset("installation.sh").language("sh"))

## Building from source

To build seamstress from source,
you’ll need the [Zig]($link.url("https://ziglang.org")) compiler, version 0.13.0.
You can download it from the linked website,
or install via a package manager like Homebrew.
To compile seamstress, clone [the repository]($link.url("https://github.com/robbielyman"))
(make sure you’re on the correct branch)
and run `zig build` in the repository root.

Doing so will place the compiled executable in `./zig-out/bin`.
You can add this folder to your `$PATH`,
copy the files installed into `zig-out` somewhere in your `$PATH`
or symlink it into your `$PATH`.
Now by default, seamstress will expect the file structure present within `zig-out`
to be reflected wherever it is copied,
so if you copy `seamstress` into `/usr/local/bin`,
you should copy `share/seamstress`
into `/usr/local/share/seamstress`,
but see the section on environment variables.

## Dependencies

Aside from the Zig compiler, seamstress depends on a number of Zig projects,
as well as some C libraries.

### Zig dependencies

This section is informational; these dependencies are fetched by the Zig compiler
when building seamstress from source and do not to be installed separately.
- [libxev]($link.url("https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev")), a cross-platform event loop inspired by `io_uring`.
- [ziglua]($link.url("https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua")), Zig bindings for the Lua C API.
Additionally, ziglua compiles and statically links against the C library `liblua`.

### C dependencies

These dependencies must be present on your system in order to use seamstress
and must be installed separately.
The Homebrew formula automates this step, but building from source does not.

### Optional dependencies

Although not necessary for all operations of seamstress,
certain functionality may not work as expected if a dependency listed here is not present.
- [LuaRocks]($link.url("https://luarocks.org/")) (in particular [busted]($link.url("https://luarocks.org/modules/lunarmodules/busted")))
is required for running the Lua unit tests.
Additionally, the seamstress Lua environment can require LuaRocks modules.
- [lua-language-server]($link.url("https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server")) in a text editor that supports the language server protocol,
is not necessary for writing seamstress programs,
but will provide documentation, completion, etc.
