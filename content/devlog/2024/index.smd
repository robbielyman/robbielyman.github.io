# [240930 – Hello World]($section.id("2024-09-30"))

Going to start keep little microblogs of work I do here.
Today I added this section to my website,
prompted by [this blog post by Loris Cro]($link.url("https://kristoff.it/blog/critical-social-infrastructure/")).

I have two laptops,
one of which lives in my office at Rutgers
and which used to run Asahi Linux.
This morning it occurred to me that my use of Linux
was holding me back.
For example, while I believe I’ve managed to get Bluetooth audio
and the webcam working independently,
I hadn’t managed to add that together to end up with a functional Zoom experience.
I need to use Zoom every week for research meetings,
which meant, functionally, that I had to carry my other laptop to work every day,
completely defeating the purpose of having a second one.

Today in class,
we continued working through a book chapter by Mladen Bestvina about real trees.
This brought us to a very heady idea:
given an action of a group on a metric space by isometries,
and a basepoint in that metric space which is not a global fixed point,
pulling back yields a pseudometric on the group.
Focusing on the pseudometric and projectivizing
yields a kind of moduli space for group actions on metric spaces:
indeed, if you assert that the action is continuous,
you can equip this space with the (quotient of the) compact–open topology,
and talk about convergence of (basepointed) group actions!

Aside from this, I worked more on my actual blog,
mostly writing a first new post for it;
porting old posts will be a slower process.
