[]($section.id("about"))

My math research is focused on geometric group theory and related topics.
My 2020 PhD thesis, [Train track maps on graphs of groups and outer automorphisms of hyperbolic groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164),
focused on automorphisms of groups acting on trees,
but my mathematical interests are fairly broad, with group theory, geometry and symmetry at the core.

# Papers and preprints

## On a lemma of Milnor and Schwarz, après Rosendal []($section.id("2025-11-05"))

[arXiv preprint: 2511.03887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03887).

**Abstract:** Perhaps the fundamental theorem of geometric group theory, the
Milnor–Schwarz lemma gives conditions under which the orbit map relating the
geometry of a geodesic metric space and the word metric on a group acting
isometrically on the space is a quasi-isometry. Pioneering work of Rosendal
makes these and other techniques of geometric group theory applicable to an
arbitrary (topological) group. We give a succinct treatment of the
Milnor–Schwarz lemma, setting it within this context. We derive some
applications of this theory to non-Archimedean groups, which have plentiful
continuous actions on graphs. In particular, we sharpen results of Bar-Natan and
Verberne on actions of "big" mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs and
clarify a project begun by Mann and Rafi to classify these mapping class groups
up to quasi-isometry, noting some extensions to the theory of mapping class
groups of locally finite infinite graphs and homeomorphism groups of Stone
spaces.

## A hyperbolic free-by-cyclic group determined by its finite quotients []($section.id("2025-09"))
with [Naomi Andrew](https://naomigandrew.wordpress.com/),
[Paige Hillen](https://sites.google.com/view/paigehillen/home/) and
[Catherine Eva Pfaff](https://catherinepfaff.com/).

[Glasgow J. Math 67 (3):500-502 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0017089525000096).

**Abstract:** We show that the group  
[`\langle a, b, c, t : a^t = b, b^t = c, c^t = ca^{-1} \rangle`]($mathtex) is
profinitely rigid amongst free-by-cyclic groups, providing the first example of
a hyperbolic free-by-cyclic group with this property.

## The complex of cuts in a Stone space []($section.id("2025-08-05"))
with Beth Branman.

[Groups Geom. Dyn. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.4171/ggd/915).

**Abstract:** Stone’s representation theorem asserts a duality between Boolean
algebras on the one hand and _Stone spaces,_ which are compact, Hausdorff and
totally disconnected, on the other. This duality implies a natural isomorphism
between the homeomorphism group of the space and the automorphism group of the
algebra. We introduce a _complex of cuts_ on which these groups act and prove
that when the algebra is countable and the space has at least five points,
these groups are the full automorphism group of the complex.

## Finiteness properties of stabilisers of oligomorphic actions []($section.id("2025-06-02"))
with 
[Francisco Fournier-Facio](https://www.fffmaths.com/),
Peter Kropholler, and
[Matt Zaremsky](https://zaremsky.github.io).

[arXiv preprint: 2506.02319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02319).

**Abstract:** An action of a group on a set is oligomorphic if it has finitely many
orbits of [`n`]($mathtex)-element subsets for all [`n`]($mathtex). We prove that for a large class of
groups (including all groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension and all
countable linear groups), for any oligomorphic action of such a group on an
infinite set there exists a finite subset whose stabiliser is not of type [`\mathrm{FP}_\infty`]($mathtex).
This leads to obstructions on finiteness properties for permutational wreath
products and twisted Brin-Thompson groups. We also prove a version for actions
on flag complexes, and discuss connections to the Boone-Higman conjecture. In
the appendix, we improve on the criterion of Bartholdi-Cornulier-Kochloukova
for finiteness properties of wreath products, and the criterion of
Kropholler-Martino for finiteness properties of graph-wreath products.

## Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces []($section.id("2025-05-15"))
with Beth Branman,
[George Domat](https://sites.google.com/view/georgedomat/home), and
[Hannah Hoganson](https://www.math.umd.edu/~hoganson/).

[Bull. London Math. Soc. 57 (8):2311-2335 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1112/blms.70097).

**Abstract:** By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a
finite generating set or the Cayley–Abels graph of a totally disconnected,
locally compact group, we detail countable connected graphs associated to
Polish groups that we term Cayley–Abels–Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a
Cayley–Abels–Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically
properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of
the Milnor–Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely
bounded set and the group equipped with a word metric with respect to a
coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other
words, groups admitting Cayley–Abels–Rosendal graphs are topological analogues
of finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological
perspective on the work of Rosendal to a geometric group theorist. We apply
these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely
characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they
are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a
Cayley–Abels–Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.

## When is the Outer Space of a free product CAT(0) []($section.id("2025-04-25"))

[Int. J. of Alg. and Comp. 35 (4) (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218196725500134).

**Abstract:** Generalizing Culler and Vogtmann’s Outer Space for the free
group, Guirardel and Levitt construct an Outer Space for a free product of
groups. We completely characterize when this space (or really its simplicial
spine) supports an equivariant piecewise-Euclidean or piecewise-hyperbolic
CAT(0) metric. Our results are mostly negative, extending thesis work of
Bridson and related to thesis work of Cunningham. In particular, provided the
dimension of the spine is at least three, it is never CAT(0). Surprisingly, we
exhibit one family of free products for which the Outer Space is
two-dimensional and does support an equivariant CAT(0) metric.

## Conformal dimension bounds for certain Coxeter group Bowditch boundaries []($section.id("2025-04-16"))
with [Elizabeth Field](https://sites.google.com/view/elizabeth-field),
[Radhika Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/radhikag), and
[Emily Stark](https://www.estark.net/).

[arXiv preprint: 2504.12404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12404).

**Abstract:** We give upper and lower bounds on the conformal dimension of the
Bowditch boundary of a Coxeter group with defining graph a complete graph and
edge labels at least three. The lower bounds are obtained by
quasi-isometrically embedding Gromov's round trees in the Davis complex. The
upper bounds are given by exhibiting a geometrically finite action on a CAT(-1)
space and bounding the Hausdorff dimension of the visual boundary of this
space. Our results imply that there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes
within each infinite family of such Coxeter groups with edge labels bounded
from above. As an application, we prove there are infinitely many
quasi-isometry classes among the family of hyperbolic groups with Pontryagin
sphere boundary. Combining our results with work of Bourdon--Kleiner proves the
conformal dimension of the boundaries of hyperbolic groups in this family
achieves a dense set in [`(1, \infty)`]($mathtex).

## One-endedness of outer automorphism groups of free products of finite and cyclic groups []($section.id("2025-02"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

In [Topology at Infinite of Discrete Groups, Contemp. Math. 812](https://doi.org/10.1090/conm/812).

**Abstract:** The main result of this paper is that the outer automorphism group of
a free product of finite groups and cyclic groups is semistable at infinity
(provided it is one ended) or semistable at each end. In a previous paper, we
showed that the group of outer automorphisms of the free product of two
nontrivial finite groups with an infinite cyclic group has infinitely many
ends, despite being of virtual cohomological dimension two. We also prove that
aside from this exception, having virtual cohomological dimension at least two
implies the outer automorphism group of a free product of finite and cyclic
groups is one ended. As a corollary, the outer automorphism groups of the free
product of four finite groups or the free product of a single finite group with
a free group of rank two are virtual duality groups of dimension two, in
contrast with the above example. Our proof is inspired by methods of Vogtmann,
applied to a complex first studied in another guise by Krstic and Vogtmann.

## Low complexity among principal fully irreducible elements of [`\mathrm{Out}(F_3)`]($mathtex) []($section.id("2024-05-06"))
with [Naomi Andrew](https://naomigandrew.wordpress.com/),
[Paige Hillen](https://sites.google.com/view/paigehillen/home/) and
[Catherine Eva Pfaff](https://catherinepfaff.com/).

[arXiv preprint: 2405.03681, to appear in AG&T](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03681).

**Abstract:** We find the shortest realized stretch factor for a fully irreducible
[`\varphi \in \mathrm{Out}(F_3)`]($mathtex) and show that it is realized by a "principal" fully irreducible
element. We also show that it is the only principal fully irreducible produced
by a single fold in any rank.

## Some New CAT(0) Free-by-Cyclic Groups []($section.id("2023-07"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

[Michigan Math. J. 73 (3):621-630 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1307/mmj/20205989).

**Abstract:** We show the existence of several new infinite families of
polynomially-growing automorphisms of free groups whose mapping tori are CAT(0)
free-by-cyclic groups. Such mapping tori are _thick,_ and thus not relatively
hyperbolic. These are the first families comprising infinitely many examples
for each rank of the nonabelian free group; they contrast strongly with
Gersten’s example of a thick free-by-cyclic group which cannot be a subgroup of
a CAT(0) group.

## Lipschitz metric isometries between outer spaces of virtually free groups []($section.id("2023-06"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

[Illinois J. Math. 67 (2):409-422 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1215/00192082-10592435).

**Abstract:** Dowdall and Taylor observed that, given a finite-index subgroup of a
free group, taking covers induces an embedding from the outer space of the free
group to the outer space of the subgroup, this embedding is an isometry with
respect to the (asymmetric) Lipschitz metric and that the embedding sends
folding paths to folding paths. The purpose of this note is to extend this
result to virtually free groups. We further extend a result of Francaviglia and
Martino, proving the existence of “candidates” for the Lipschitz distance
between points in the outer space of the virtually free group. Additionally, we
identify a deformation retraction of the spine of the outer space for the
virtually free group with the space considered by Krstić and Vogtmann.

## On Whitehead's cut vertex lemma []($section.id("2023-01-26"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

[J. Group Theory 26 (4):665-675 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1515/jgth-2022-0089).

**Abstract:** One version of Whitehead’s famous cut vertex lemma says that if an
element of a free group is part of a free basis, then a certain graph
associated to its conjugacy class that we call the star graph is either
disconnected or has a cut vertex. We state and prove a version of this lemma
for conjugacy classes of elements and convex-cocompact subgroups of groups
acting cocompactly on trees with finitely generated edge stabilizers.
## Train track maps on graphs of groups []($section.id("2022-11-12"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

[Groups Geom. Dyn. 16(4):1389-1422 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.4171/ggd/698).

**Abstract:** In this paper we develop the theory of train track maps on graphs of
groups. Expanding a definition of Bass, we define a notion of a map of a graph
of groups, and of a homotopy equivalence. We prove that under one of two
technical hypotheses, any homotopy equivalence of a graph of groups may be
represented by a relative train track map. The first applies in particular to
graphs of groups with finite edge groups, while the second applies in
particular to certain generalized Baumslag–Solitar groups.

## Folding-like techniques for CAT(0) cube complexes []($section.id("2022-07"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman), with
[Robert Kropholler](http://www.robertkropholler.com/) and
[Michael Ben-Zvi](https://sites.google.com/view/benzvi).

[Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 173 (1):227-238 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305004121000645).

**Abstract:** In a seminal paper, Stallings introduced folding of morphisms of
graphs. One consequence of folding is the representation of finitely-generated
subgroups of a finite-rank free group as immersions of finite graphs.
Stallings’s methods allow one to construct this representation algorithmically,
giving effective, algorithmic answers and proofs to classical questions about
subgroups of free groups. Recently Dani–Levcovitz used Stallings-like methods
to study subgroups of right-angled Coxeter groups, which act geometrically on
CAT(0) cube complexes. In this paper we extend their techniques to fundamental
groups of non-positively curved cube complexes.

## CTs for free products []($section.id("2022-03-16"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman).

[arXiv preprint: 2203.08868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08868).

**Abstract:** The fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with trivial
edge groups is a free product. We are interested in those outer automorphisms
of such a free product that permute the conjugacy classes of the vertex groups.
We show that in particular cases of interest, such as where vertex groups are
themselves finite free products of finite and cyclic groups, given such an
outer automorphism, after passing to a positive power, the outer automorphism
is represented by a particularly nice kind of relative train track map called a
CT. CTs were first introduced by Feighn and Handel for outer automorphisms of
free groups. We develop the theory of attracting laminations for and principal
automorphisms of free products. We prove that outer automorphisms of free
products satisfy an index inequality reminiscent of a result of Gaboriau,
Jaeger, Levitt and Lustig and sharpening a result of Martino. Finally, we prove
a result reminiscent of a theorem of Culler on the fixed subgroup of an
automorphism of a free product whose outer class has finite order.

## Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces []($section.id("2021-01-26"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman), with
[Santana Afton](https://sites.google.com/view/santanaafton/home),
[Danny Calegari](https://sites.google.com/view/santanaafton/home),
and
[Lvzhou Chen](https://lvzhouchen.github.io/).

[Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 149:1791-1799 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1090/proc/15316).

**Abstract:** Given a finite subgroup [`G`]($mathtex) of the mapping class group of a surface
[`S`]($mathtex), the Nielsen realization problem asks whether G can be realized as a finite
group of homeomorphisms of [`S`]($mathtex). In 1983, Kerckhoﬀ showed that for [`S`]($mathtex) a finite-
type surface, any finite subgroup [`G`]($mathtex) may be realized as a group of isometries
of some hyperbolic metric on [`S`]($mathtex). We extend Kerckhoﬀ’s result to orientable,
infinite-type surfaces. As applications, we classify torsion elements in the
mapping class group of the plane minus a Cantor set, and also show that
topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the
identity do not embed continuously into the mapping class group of [`S`]($mathtex). Finally,
we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of [`S`]($mathtex) are finite,
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.

## Extensions of hyperbolic groups have locally uniform exponential growth []($section.id("2020-12-29"))
(as Rylee Alanza Lyman)
with 
[Robert Kropholler](http://www.robertkropholler.com/) and
[Thomas Ng](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasng192/).

[arXiv preprint: 2012.14880](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03681).

**Abstract:** We introduce a quantitative characterization of subgroup alternatives modeled
on the Tits alternative in terms of group laws and investigate when this
property is preserved under extensions. We develop a framework that lets us
expand the classes of groups known to have locally uniform exponential growth
to include extensions of either word hyperbolic or right-angled Artin groups by
groups with locally uniform exponential growth. From this, we deduce that the
automorphism group of a torsion-free one-ended hyperbolic group has locally
uniform exponential growth. Our methods also demonstrate that automorphism
groups of torsion-free one-ended toral relatively hyperbolic groups and certain
right-angled Artin groups satisfy our quantitative subgroup alternative.
