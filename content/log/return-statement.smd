This summer I spent twelve weeks at [The Recurse Center]($link.url("https://recurse.com")),
a self-directed program that describes itself as “like a writer’s retreat, but for programmers”.
Many participants write a “return statement” describing and reflecting on their time with the program.
The name is a cute little pun: many functions in a computer program finish with a “return statement”,
which allows the function to yield a bit of data as a result of the function’s execution.
Anyway, this is mine.

# Some statistics

According to [my GitHub](https://github.com/robbielyman) activity log,
I created approximately 100 commits and 9 new repositories.
By volume, I almost certainly wrote the most code in [seamstress](https://github.com/robbielyman/seamstress)
and [my solutions repository for Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/robbielyman/aoc-2022-rs).
Eyeballing the former I count easily over 15,000 lines of code added and/or deleted;
for the latter my final solutions add up to about 7,000 lines of code.

I wrote 60 checkins, one for each weekday I was in the program
(I didn’t manage to always write one during the day it was about, but I did manage to write all 60).
I ran a weekly “Audio Hang” as a space to chat informally about audio programming,
synthesis, DSP and music.
I put JavaScript and Rust to serious use for the first time,
served a webpage to `localhost` for the first time,
made a game in the browser with friends,
a game of solitaire in the terminal by myself, a toy programming language
(and started working through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com),
which will eventually result in a second toy programming language),
pair programmed for the first (and second and third and and and) time,
gave two programming-focused presentations
and one “non-programming talk” about some of the math behind implementing digital filters.

I made sweeping changes to my work-in-progress version 2.0.0 seamstress repeatedly,
aimed at improving the quality of my design
and clarifying my vision for the project in the process.

I made many new friends, whom I dearly hope to stay in touch with for years to come.
I performed livecoded music sets twice.
I was in more spaces that included a pronoun checkin than I had gone to since college.
I iterated on myself with the same vigor that I iterated on code,
ultimately readopting the name Robbie after almost a decade of disuse.
(Hence the title of this blog post.)
