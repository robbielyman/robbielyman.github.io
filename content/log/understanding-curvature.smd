As a geometric group theorist interested in “CAT(0)”
and “hyperbolic geometry”,
I appeasr to care very deeply about notions like “curvature”,
but I have to admit that my understanding of what it means is not that deep.
This post is an attempt (one of likely several)
to deepen my understanding.
I’d like to bring you along for the ride.

# Curves

## Curvature of curves is not intrinsic

In differential geometry classes,
curvature is often mooted as an inherently _two_-dimensional phenomenon,
or rather, one that begins at dimension two.
Yet, the word that mathematicians use to describe
one-dimensional shapes sitting inside another shape is _curve._
This is maybe a silly way of arguing,
but I think this use of language suggests that curvature should have a one-dimensional meaning.
Indeed, the point of a “curve” is that it is not “straight”
(although perversely, for a mathematician a straight line counts as a curve).

So what gives? The reason for this is that in dimension one,
curvature is an “extrinsic” phenomenon.

Let me explain.
First, let’s make sense of what it would mean for something
to be an _intrinsic_ property.
Consider the [real line]($link.page('log/for-completeness')).
Mathematicians usually denote it $\mathbb{R}$ for “real”,
sometimes decorated as $\mathbb{R}^1$ to indicate the dimension
and distinguish it from something like the Cartesian plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and so on.
For a mathematician, $\mathbb{R}$ lives “off by itself”.
Although we as humans typically reason about things spatially,
it’s important to be able to discard what is not part of the definition of $\mathbb{R}$
and retain only what is.
In other words, when I said “consider the real line”,
maybe you imagined a line _living inside_ a three-dimensional space
(I like to think pictorially, so I know I did this).
But the point is, mathematically that three-dimensinal space
_is not necessarily there._

Now consider a curve inside the plane,
say, or a curved line in three-dimensional space.
Maybe the curve closes up, or maybe it stops short.
Or maybe it continues forever in one direction
and stops short in another.
Any of these is more or less fine,
but let’s pretend for a moment that the curve goes on forever
in both directions.
Like for example,
take the graph of the function $y = x^2$ in the plane.
Considered “topologically”, this curve is in some sense “the same”
as $\mathbb{R}$.
Making this precise is part of the content of a first course in topology,
but we already know this to be true:
even the expression of this curve as the graph of a
(continuous, in fact smooth) function of one variable makes that manifest to us.

There are many possible curves that have this property!
The graph of $y = x^n$ for any positive integer $n$
works just fine, for example,
as does the set of points satisfying the equation $y^2 - x^2 = 1$
(a _hyperbola_)
where $y > 0$.
Each of these curves, though,
has different _geometry_ when thought of as sitting inside the plane,
as we shall see and attempt to quantify.

Therefore there is no _one_ way to define a notion of curvature for a curve—it always depends on _how_ that curve
is sitting inside another space.
That’s fine!
Sometimes in math things just work that way.
What’s maybe more surprising, as we’ll see, hopefully in a later post,u
is that curvatucre _does_ become “intrinsic”
in higher dimensions.

## What should curvature mean?

Intuitively, any quantitative measure of curvature
should probably have the following properties.

+ The curvature of a straight line is zero,
  because lines are not curved.
+ The curvature of a circle should be _inversely_ proportional to its radius.
  Right? As a circle gets smaller,
  tracing it out you draw a tighter and tighter curve,
  whereas as a circle gets bigger and bigger,
  you notice its “curviness” less and less until,
  “in the limit” you get a straight line.
+ Curvature should make sense for any reasonable curev.

As mathematicians, we love unreasonable things.
There are definitely curves that we would like to avoid
thinking about here.
The “topologist’s sine curve” is a good example of one.
Another is a “space-filling curve”.

Anyway, the classical way of defining the curvature (at a point)
of a curve $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}$^2 is, to my mind,
pretty satisfying.

Suppose our curve is not just continuous but has a first derivative everywhere.
There are two things I could mean here:
first of all we could be thinking of our curve in the Cartesian plane
as the _graph_ of a function,
or we could think of it _parametrically_
as $\gamma = (x(t), y(t))$.
Let’s work parametrically.
I want there to exist a _tangent line_ at every point of our curve.
Parametrically, this line has the equation
$(x(t_0) + tx'(t_0), y(t_0) + ty'(t_0))$
_provided_ these derivatives exist.
In other words, a sufficient condition for our parametric
function to have a tangent line
is for the parametrizing functions $x$ and $y$
to have derivatives everywhere.
Let’s go ahead and assume that.

For the parabola, for example,
we could parametrize it as $x(t) = t$ and $y(t) = t^2$;
both of these functions have derivatives everywhere.
For the circle of radius $R$,
we could parametrize this curve as $x(t) = R\cos t$
and $y(t) = R\sin t$;
both of these functions also have derivatives everywhere.

## Defining curvature

Anyway, if we fix a point on our curve
and understand the tangent line to that curve at the point,
we can also understand _circles_ tangent to our curve
at that point.
There are infinitely many of these and by
_tangent_ I just mean that close to our point $p$,
the circle does not cross the curve,
in the same way that the tangent line does not because it has,
in some sense, the “same slope” as the curve.
