[]($section.id('summary'))

The “moduli space” idea is maybe my favorite meta-strategy in mathematics.
It came up yesterday in the graduate class I’m teaching this semester,
and I wanted to share this instance of it and talk about why
I find it so cool.

# A little background

Sorry for the throat-clearing here.
I’m perpetually unsure where precisely to aim a blog post.
Like, with a paper or a book or a review,
the amount of familiarity with the jargon of math you can expect
a reader to have feels much clearer.
At least in theory,
this post has a much wider audience.

So: I’m going to talk about groups and metric spaces in this section.
I’m aiming to be comprehensible,
which is allied with but actually different from being gentle.
Like Jane Austen refusing to pepper “said Mr. Darcy” throughout
her very talky writing,
I know that if you are reading this, you are not one of those
“dull Elves As have not a great deal of Ingenuity themselves”.

## Groups

A group is the abstract concept of symmetry.
If you have an object, the collection of its symmetries
is an example of a group.
So like, think about a regular octagon, like the shape of a stop sign.
You can rotate the octagon one “click” or flip it and the shape is the same.
These are symmetries.
Symmetries can be composed (rotate and then flip),
and this composition is associative, but need not be commutative.
Every symmetry can be undone, and “do nothing” is a symmetry.

This abstracting move—removing the object
but leaving behind its symmetries—is a little odd, but extremely useful.

Groups often feel like doing algebra:
composing symmetries is represented in symbols the way
multiplication is represented in algebra;
you just have to remember that $xy$ is not necessarily $yx$
(which, if you’ve multiplied matrices before, is not so bad).

## Actions

If you have a group, repatriating it with an object to be the symmetries of
is the idea of a _group action._

In symbols, group actions feel like multiplying matrices and vectors together.
If your matrix is square (and invertible),
this is an honest example of a group action,
where the matrix is an element of a group
and the vector is part of the object (the vector space)
which the group is acting on.

Weirdly (because it feels like it comes from the human writing system
more than, like, some inherent truth)
group actions have a “handedness” to them.
An action “on the left” looks like the pair $(g, x)$
with $g$ in your group and $x$ in your object it’s acting on
going to $g.x$, a new thing your object.
You know that it’s on the left because you have that
$g.(h.x) = (gh).x$,
whereas if you act “on the right”,
you instead have $(x, g) \mapsto x.g$
and when you consider pairs, you instead have that $(x.g).h = x.(gh)$.

## Metric spaces

A metric space is the abstraction of the idea of geometry and distance.
It is a set $X$, together with a way of measuring distances
between points of $X$.
Formally this is a function $d \colon X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$.
That is, it takes in a pair of points of $X$,
say $x$ and $y$,
and spits out a number, $d(x,y)$,
which you should think of as “the distance from $x$ to $y$”.

There are three properties that a distance function should have,
although being mathematicians we often go “well…” and see what happens if we drop them.

The first is that the distance between $x$ and $y$
should be nonnegative and moreover if $d(x,y) = 0$, then $x = y$.
(Dropping this latter assumption, you get a “pseudometric”,
which will come up later in this post.)

The second is that $d(x,y)$ should be the same as $d(y,x)$.
This makes intuitive sense until you consider the real world,
where headwinds, altitude differences,
everything that is different between traveling “as the crow flies”
and making do in the messy real world,
factors in.
Dropping this assumption you get the notion of an “asymmetric metric”.
I happen to think about one particular asymmetric metric
often enough that I can recall it to my mom’s attention
by referring to its asymmetry.

Finally, and most importantly,
there is the “triangle inequality”:
given $x$ and $y$, for any third point $z$,
it should be the case that $d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z,y)$.
This makes intuitive sense—factoring in the distance to $z$
has the potential to take you “out of your way” as you travel.

## Isometries

The right notion of symmetry for a metric space
is called _isometry._
An isometry of a metric space $(X,d)$
is a (bijective) function $f \colon X \to X$
with the property that $d(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y)$.
You can think of $f$ as just moving $X$ around rigidly
without distorting distances.

So when a group acts on a metric space $(X,d)$,
we will say that the action is _by isometries_
if $d(g.x, g.y) = d(x, y)$ for every group element $g$.
