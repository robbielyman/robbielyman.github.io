Who is this blog for?
That’s a good question!
Let me explain my thinking.
Sometimes I am writing for me:
to clarify an idea, or record in words a thought that I want to stick.
But often I am writing to be read;
I love talking to people, and I often have a lot to say.
Blogging is a great way to try and say the thing I want to say,
in part because it can be rude to just hold forth at somebody.

Some of what I write about is technical;
I’m very aware that my areas of technical expertise
don’t overlap perfectly with many people who might want to read what I write.
(Probably said that way, this is a universal experience,
but it’s interesting how mathematics receives it even more intensely:
for one, people often have strong negative associations with mathematics
that are called to mind when you tell them what you do.
For another, mathematicians can be particularly bad at talking
technically with each other about their interests.)
It is my goal to at least try to bring everyone along everywhere I go.
If I am failing at this goal, feel free to tell me so!
It would be useful to know if there is a blog post you want to read
but find too tough to finish.
