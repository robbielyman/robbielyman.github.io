# Reinit

Hi again. This is Robbie.
For most of a decade, I used to go by Rylee.
I do math,
I make music,
I write code,
I'm learning Japanese.
I like graphic design, writing, cooking, some other stuff too.
Lately I've been discovering that running and the gym are actually fun and good things,
which would have blown my sixteen-year-old self's mind.

This is a blog. Let's go.

# Topology

I was going to tell you about a fact in group theory,
but I was talking to [Jeremy](https://jdkaplan.dev/) about
my first favorite theorem in math—the one that blew my mind for the first time—and realized I should just write about that instead.

It's a theorem in Topology.
Topology starts with numbers—subsets of [`\mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex).
These have a natural way of measuring closeness: the _distance formula_ on [`\mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex)
is a kind of generalization of the Pythagorean theorem,
saying that the distance between two points [`\vec{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)`]($mathtex) and [`\vec{y} = (y_1,\ldots,y_n)`]($mathtex)
is

```=mathtex
d(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - y_n)^2}.
```

One way that this notion of closeness gets used is the following:
say that a subset [`U \subset \mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex)
is _open_ if whenever [`U`]($mathtex) contains a point [`x`]($mathtex),
it actually contains alllllll the points sufficiently close to [`x`]($mathtex)
(the jargon is "a small neighborhood of [`x`]($mathtex)"),
as measured by that distance function.

Here are some facts:
- The whole space and the empty set are open.

The fact that [`\mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex) is open is pretty clear,
but the fact that [`\varnothing`]($mathtex) is open is one of
those instances in math where being a scholar of the empty set requires clear sight:
since there are _no_ points to ask about, it _is_ (vacuously) true
that for every point in sight, the empty set also contains a little neigbhorhood of that point.

- The union of an arbitrary number of open sets is open.
- The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.

Topology as a subject starts by taking those facts as a _definition,_ and then running wild.
That is, a _topological space_ is a set (whose objects may be nice things, like elements of [`\mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex),
but truly need not be) with a specified collection of subsets which are called _open,_
which satisfy the properties above.

## Pavel Urysohn

[Pavel Urysohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Urysohn) was a mathematician born in what is now the Ukraine in 1898,
but he finished high school in Moscow.
He earned a PhD in 1921 (yes, the year he turned 24!)
and traveled a little in Europe with mathematician [Pavel Aleksandrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Alexandrov).
The recent historical consensus, which I only learned this year,
is that the two were lovers, which I like to hear personally, since Urysohn's math really hit for me.
Also, extremely strong move to date somebody with the same first name as you.
Anyway, while they were traveling in France, Urysohn drowned while swimming at the age of 26.

Urysohn was working when topology itself was a very new field.
For example, he and Alexandrov gave the modern formulation of a foundational and very peculiar mathematical property
called _compactness._
He also constructed a really profoundly beautiful and cursèd object:
a metric space which contains an isometric copy of every separable metric space.
Kid did good math.

## Separation axioms

One of the frequent topics in a first topology course is working with the
so-called "separation axioms".
These are properties that a topological space can have that make it behave progressively more and more like
a subset of [`\mathbb{R}^n`]($mathtex).
The most famous of these is the _Hausdorff_ property,
which I like to remember by the following punny explanation:
a space [`X`]($mathtex) is Hausdorff if any two distinct points [`x`]($mathtex) and [`y`]($mathtex) in [`X`]($mathtex)
can be "housed off" of each other, in the sense that there are open sets [`U \ni x`]($mathtex) and [`V \ni y`]($mathtex)
whose intersection is empty.
