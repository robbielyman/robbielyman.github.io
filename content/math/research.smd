I am an expert working in the field of geometric group theory,
with particular knowledge about the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
outer automorphism groups of free groups,
and the growing field of geometric group theory for (Polish) topological groups.
Besides this, my mathematical interests are broad.

Here is a [CV]($link.siteAsset('Lyman.pdf')).
From 2015–2024, I published as Rylee Alanza Lyman;
this is the name on many of the papers below.

- **The complex of cuts in a Stone Space**

> Stone’s representation theorem asserts a duality between Boolean algebras
on the one hand and Stone spaces, which are compact, Hausdorff, and totally disconnected, on the other.
This duality implies a natural isomorphism between the homeomorphism group of the space
and the automorphism group of the algebra.
We introduce a _complex of cuts_ on which these groups act,
and prove that when the algebra is countable and the space has at least five points,
that these groups are the full automorphism group of the complex.

We also show that it is the only principal fully irreducible produced by a single fold in any rank.

> The main result of this paper is that the outer automorphism group
of a free product of finite groups and cyclic groups
is semistable at infinity (provided it is one ended) or semistable at each end.
In a previous paper, we showed that the group of outer automorphisms of the free product of
two nontrivial finite groups with an infinite cyclic group has infinitely many ends,
despite being of virtual cohomological dimension two.
We also prove that aside from this exception,
having virtual cohomological dimension at least two implies the outer automorphism group
of finite and cyclic groups is one ended.
As a corollary, the outer automorphism groups of the free product of four finite groups
or the free product of a single finite group with a free group of rank two
are virtual duality groups of dimension two, in contrast with the above example.
Our proof is inspired by methods of Vogtmann, applied to a complex first studied in another guise
by Krstić and Vogtmann.

> Generalizing Culler and Vogtmann’s Outer Space for the free group,
Guirardel and Levitt construct an Outer Space for a free product of groups.
We completely characterize when this space (or really its simplicial spine)
supports an equivariant piecewise-Euclidean or piecewise-hyperbolic CAT(0) metric.
Our results are mostly negative, extending thesis work of Bridson and related to thesis work of Cunningham.
In particular, provided the dimension of the spine is at least three,
it is never CAT(0).
Surprisingly, we exhibit one family of free products for which the Outer Space is two-dimensional
and _does_ support an equivariant CAT(0) metric.

> One version of Whitehead’s famous cut vertex lemma says that if an element of a free group
is part of a free basis, then a certain graph associated to its conjugacy class
that we call _the star graph_ is either disconnected or has a cut vertex.
We state and prove a version of this lemma
for conjugacy classes of elements and convex–cocompact subgroups of groups acting
cocompactly on trees with finitely generated edge stabilizers.

> Dowdall and Taylor observed that given a finite-index subgroup of a free group,
taking covers induces an embedding from the Outer Space of the free group
to the Outer Space of the subgroup,
that this embedding is an isometry with respect to the (asymmetric) Lipschitz metric,
and that the embedding sends folding paths to folding paths.
The purpose of this note is to extend this result to virtually free groups.
We further extend a result of Francaviglia and Martino,
proving the existence of “candidates” for the Lipschitz distance between points
in the Outer Space of the virtually free group.
Additionally we identify a deformation retraction of the spine of the Outer Space
for the virtually free group with the space considered by Krstić and Vogtmann.

> The fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with trivial edge groups is a free product.
We are interested in those outer automorphisms of such a free product
that permute the conjugacy classes of the vertex groups.
We show that in particular cases of interest,
such as where vertex groups are themselves finite free products of finite and cyclic groups,
given such an outer automorphism,
after passing to a positive power,
the outer automorphism is represented by a particularly nice kind of relative train track map called a CT.
CTs were first introducd by Feighn and Handel for outer automorphisms of free groups.
We develop the theory of attracting laminations for and principal automorphisms of free products.
We prove that outer automorphisms of free products satisfy an index inequality
reminiscent of a result of Gaboriau, Jaeger, Levitt and Lustig
and sharpening a result of Martino.
Finally, we prove a result reminiscent of a theorem of Culler on the fixed subgroup
of an automorphism of a free product whose outer class has finite order.

> In this paper we develop the theory of train track maps on graphs of groups.
Expanding a definition of Bass,
we define a notion of a map of a graph of groups,
and of a homotopy equivalence.
We prove that under one of two technical hypotheses,
any homotopy equivalence of a graph of groups
may be represented by a relative train track map.
The first applies in particular to graphs of groups with finite edge groups,
while the second applies in particular to certain generalized Baumslag–Solitar groups.

- **Extensions of Hyperbolic Groups Have Locally Uniform Exponential Growth**

> We introduce a quantitative characterization of subgroup alternatives
modeled on the Tits alternative in terms of group laws
and investigate when this property is preserved under extensions.
We develop a framework that lets us expand the classes of groups known to have
locally uniform exponential growth to includ extensions
of either word hyperbolic or right-angled Artin groups by groups with locally uniform exponential growth.
From this, we deduce that the automorphism group of a torsion-free one-ended hyperbolic group
has locally uniform exponential growth.
Our methods also demonstrate that automorphism groups
of torsion-free one-ended toral relatively hyperbolic groups
and certain right-angled Artin groups satisfy our quantitative subgroup alternative.

> In a seminal paper, Stallings introduced folding of morphisms of graphs.
One consequence of folding is the representation of finitely generated
subgroups of a finite-rank free group as immersions of finite graphs.
Stallings’s methods allow one to construct this representation algorithmically,
giving effective, algorithmic answers and proofs to classical questions
about subgroups of free groups.
Recently Dani–Levcovitz used Stallings-like methods to study subgroups of right-angled Coxeter groups,
which act geometrically on CAT(0) cube complexes.
In this paper we extend their techniques to fundamental groups of non-positively curved cube complexes.

> We show the existence of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing
automorphisms of free groups whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups.
Such mapping tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic.
These are the first families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank of the nonabelian free group;
they contrast strongly with Gersten’s example of a thick free-by-cyclic group
which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.

- **Nielsen Realization for Infinite-Type Surfaces**

> []($block)
> Given a finite subgroup $G$ of the mapping class group of a surface $S$,
the Nielsen realization problem asks whether $G$ can be realized as a finite group of homomorphisms of $S$.
In 1983, Kerckhoff showed that for $S$ a finite-type surface,
any finite subgroup $G$ may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on $S$.
We extend Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group of the plane minus a Cantor set,
and also show that topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity
do not embed continuously into the mapping class group of $S$.
Finally, we show that compact subgoups of the mapping class group of $S$ are finite,
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.
