Hi! My name is Robbie Lyman.

## Now (November 2025)
Currently I am working on long-overdue revisions to a research paper,
learning professional techniques for pop music production,
practicing for the JLPT N3 Japanese language proficiency test,
and preparing to run a marathon with my brothers. 

This semester I am teaching College Algebra.

## Work
I work as an assistant professor in the department of [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/mathematics-and-computer-science)
at [Rutgers University–Newark](https://www.newark.rutgers.edu/).
Before becoming an assistant professor,
I was at Rutgers on a postdoctoral fellowship from the National Science Foundation working with Lee Mosher.
I earned my PhD in mathematics from Tufts University, where my advisor was Kim Ruane.

## Research
My [math research](math) focuses on geometric group theory.
I like symmetry, metric geometry, group actions, topology, automorphisms of groups,
and many many more things, mathematically.

I have published papers on things like the following.
The structure and dynamics of outer automorphism groups of free groups and related groups,
CAT(0) or CAT(-1) geometries for free-by-cyclic groups and Coxeter groups,
"Stallings folding" for CAT(0) cube complexes,
mapping class groups of surfaces of infinite type,
homeomorphism groups of Stone spaces (or automorphim groups of Boolean algebras),
and Christian Rosendal's program coarse geometry for topological groups.

## Code
I organize the [Zig NYC](https://zignyc.github.io/) meetups
around the [Zig programming language.](https://ziglang.org/)
In 2024 I spent a summer at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/),
a programming community centered around a 12-week "writer's retreat for programmers." 

I help maintain the Zig bindings for Lua project [Ziglua](https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua).
In 2023 I wrote a Lua environment for creative coding implemented Zig called Seamstress.

## Music
I've played piano since I was eight years old.
In 2022 I wrote, recorded and released an album of music titled "Learning to Run"
as [Alanza](https://alanza.bandcamp.com/),
centered around some Max4Live devices I made called [bitters](https://github.com/robbielyman/bitters-max/).

I'm working on a more solidly pop artist project, which I'm calling [Alonzo](https://alonzo.zip),
but it's very early days yet. I'm also upping my production skills, working with [Terence Lam](https://www.youtube.com/@terence_p_lam)
