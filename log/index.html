    <a href="/log/romanization/"><h4>Romanization</h4></a>
    <span>February 10, 2025</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> One of the things that fascinates me about language is the degree to which the written representation of language does or does not capture the pronunciation. On the one hand you have French, which I don't speak with any skill at all, but do sometimes marvel at comparing text to what I understand to be the correct pronunciation of it. American English of all stripes does this too, of course: easy to imagine somebody tripping over the correct-to-locals pronunciation of placenames like Delhi (NY), Worcester (MA), Wayzata (MN), or Houston St (in Manhattan). On the other you have things like the Hepburn system for romanization of Japanese.</p></div></div>

    <span>February 07, 2025</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p>I had some intention of starting a mailing list. I thought maybe I would share musings about songs I like on it. Part of my personal path lately is about finding the right level to aim at. I think a newsletter is higher than I should aim right now; I'm trying to avoid the pride loop. Anyway, here's some songs that were a big part of my January. They're arranged in a reasonable listening order, and I’ll write something about each track, but I'm trying to just press send, since it's almost a week into February now.</p></div></div>

    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p>Over on <a href="https://llllllll.co">the lines forum</a>, I snagged the opportunity to be the one who started <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/goals-2025/70222/35">the yearly goals thread</a>. (Actually, I was hoping that one of the previous posters would have started it, but then suddenly it was almost the new year and the thread had still not started.) I really appreciated these threads over the past couple years. Slightly uncharacteristically, my contribution, which I just wrote today, has very little in the way of specific achievements I'm in pursuit of. Anyway, the purpose of this post is to riff on what I wrote there. (By the way, if you're reading this and would like an invitation to join the conversation, please feel invited to sign up and chime in.)</p></div></div>
  
    <a href="/log/seamstress-is-an-art-engine/"><h4>Seamstress is an art engine</h4></a>
    <span>January 10, 2025</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p>Seamstress is an "art engine". That's not a term, as far as I'm aware, but I think it describes accurately where I'm hoping to take it. Programmers might be familiar with the concept of a "game engine", like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a>, <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot</a>, or <a href="https://love2d.org" target="_blank">Love2D</a>. None of these programs are games, rather, they <em>enable</em> building games by attempting to let a user focus on what is expressive and joyful about making a game rather than what can feel like drudgery.</p><p>I started writing Seamstress because I was lonely and a little bored. It grew out of a love letter to the <a href="https://monome.org" target="_blank">monome</a> <a href="https://github.com/monome/norns" target="_blank">norns</a>, a little "sound computer" which orchestrates an inspiring and accessible palette for <a href="https://llllllll.co" target="_blank">a truly special community</a> by weaving together <a href="https://supercollider.github.io" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a>, a general-purpose synthesis and musical coding framework, <a href="https://github.com/monome/softcut-lib" target="_blank">softcut</a>, a powerful audio buffer manipulation library, and <a href="https://lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a> scripting for designing sequencers, user interfaces, speaking with external devices, drawing to a screen, and so on.</p></div></div>

    <span>December 08, 2024</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> This is a post inspired by my approach to this year’s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a>, but it does not contain spoilers. Instead I want to talk about how being more “data-oriented” has helped my thinking about coding problems.</p></div></div>
  
    <a href="/log/advent-of-code-learning/"><h4>What I learned from Advent Of Code, or: That time I wrote a blog post and linked to it in the Zig issue tracker</h4></a>
    <span>December 05, 2024</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p>I’m doing Advent of Code again this year; so far I’ve been very pleasantly surprised that my facility for solving the problems has improved. (Of course, I’m well aware that the difficulty is likely to ramp up soon, so I may end up eating my words.) Previously, I did the 2023 Advent of Code as it happened in Zig. <em>Pace</em> Loris Cro, <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/advent-of-code-zig/">who wrote a great blog post on the subject</a>, I think that despite the way Advent of Code problems are at odds with the kinds of software problems that Zig aims itself at solving, doing Advent of Code is a great way to gain familiarity with Zig. Over this past summer I also did the 2022 Advent of Code problems as a way of learning Rust. Today, solving the 5th problem for 2024, it occurred to me that Rust had taught me something surprisingly useful for my Zig solution. The purpose of this post is to talk about what I learned—this post does not contain spoilers for any Advent of Code problems, and indeed is not really “about” Advent of Code at all: as I was writing it, it became clear that part of this blog post actually belongs on the Zig issue tracker.</p></div></div>

    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> Today <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337">my 15th posting</a> to the arXiv went live! I intend to write about some of the other aspects of that paper elsewhere (possibly another post on this blog), since I think it really clarified something important for me, but I wanted to explain one insight that made a mysterious thing less mysterious to me: “double cosets”.</p></div></div>

    <a href="/log/how-magic-is-too-magic/"><h4>How magic is too magic? Personalities of programming languages</h4></a>
    <span>November 18, 2024</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> I’ve heard people observe that although we often think of language as purely a medium for expressing something that exists prior to language, that the words available to us shape who we are as well. I think there’s some truth to this: I took four semesters of Japanese in grad school—not enough to approach fluency without intensive immersion, but plenty to start feeling out the language. I found that at the time my personality as expressed in Japanese was a bit more cautious than I am in English.</p><p>It’s interesting to observe that this difference in what I <em>want</em> to express and <em>how</em> is also present for me in programming. Not every language I’ve written a line of has a personality for me yet—mostly this correlates with how seriously I’ve learned what the language has to offer, but interestingly as I’ve improved as a programmer, the personality associations have also started coming faster.</p></div></div>

    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> I’ll go ahead and begin by claiming that generative AI has plateaued, if not already peaked. I might come back to justify that claim later on, but the purpose of this post is to share some musings on generative AI as a tool for accessing expertise.</p></div></div>
  
    <a href="/log/return-statement/"><h4>return &quot;Robbie&quot;;</h4></a>
    <span>September 28, 2024</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p> This summer I spent twelve weeks at <a href="https://recurse.com">The Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed program that describes itself as “like a writer’s retreat, but for programmers”. Many participants write a “return statement” describing and reflecting on their time with the program. The name is a cute little pun: many functions in a computer program finish with a “return statement”, which allows the function to yield a bit of data as a result of the function’s execution. Anyway, this is mine.</p></div></div>
  
    <a href="/log/for-completeness/"><h4>For completeness: real numbers</h4></a>
    <span>April 20, 2024</span>
    <div class="summary"><div id=summary><p>In mathematics, if you squint, the word “real” has a kind of eldritch quality. Although calculus students work confidently with them, and they enable all kinds of nice behavior in topology, the definition of a /real number/ is, well, surreal. The title of this blog post is a pun. You might ask why we need the real numbers, and one answer is “for completeness”. For the same reason, I thought a blog post would be useful.</p></div></div>
